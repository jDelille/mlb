## MLB data project using Next.js 13.2, React, TypeScript, and SCSS.

The goal of this project is experiment with Next.js 13.2, use advanced TypeScript techniques, and use advanced SCSS techniques. This project is about displaying MLB data using the ESPN apis found in this repo: https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b. The project will be relatively simple in content. I want the main focus to be about Next.js 13.2 and advanced TypeScript and SCSS techniques to write better, cleaner, and safer code.
